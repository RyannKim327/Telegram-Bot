### Introduction
> We've beed developing facebook bot since 2022, and I applied bot in one of my project which is `Sulat Baybayin X`. The one of the reason why I'm still doing this, is to help students to lessen and to learn through their social media accounts. But unfortunately, facebook don't want it, by always locking and blocking my accounts, insteead of blocking and locking pornographic contents.
